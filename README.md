# BLOGOTRON

In-Dev node.js markdown blog hoster. Very minimal, because I can't node.js. Just dump
.md posts into `/posts/`, and they'll get rendered as boostrappy weirdness. Customize
`posts.ejs` and `index.ejs` in `/views/` to alter pretty much the entire method of
post rendering.


I'm hosting it on heroku at ~~~[blogotron.heroku.com](https://blogotron.herokuapp.com/)~~~ 
now with url[blog.your-waifu-is-sh.it](blog.your-waifu-is-sh.it)!
