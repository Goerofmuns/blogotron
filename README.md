# BLOGOTRON

In-Dev node.js markdown blog hoster. Very minimal, because I can't node.js. Just dump
.md posts into `/posts/`, and they'll get rendered as boostrappy weirdness. Customize
`posts.ejs` and `index.ejs` in `/views/` to alter pretty much the entire method of
post rendering.


I'm hosting it on heroku at ~~blogotron.heroku.com~~ now
with url [blog.your-waifu-is-sh.it](http://blog.your-waifu-is-sh.it)!

## Todo
* ~Add in browser editor~ Done
* Improve CSS features
* ~Mobile Interface~ Boostrap 4 fixes
