# blogotron about

This is a demo blog being served by Blogotron. Blog posts are made in markdown form in the
posts directory, and enumerated below in a list of clickable links, which will parse the
markdown into html, inject it into a template document and then show it. Nothing special
but I kinda like it.

See [setup](./setup) for config.
