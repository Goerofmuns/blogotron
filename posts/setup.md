# Setup Instructions

Setting up blogotron is very simple.

Requirements:

* git
* npm

First clone the repository. Then cd in and run `npm i` to install dependencies. 
Run `npm start`, which in turn runs `node server.js`, and the blog will be served at 
localhost:8080. 

# Configuration
For now configuration is done via altering hard-coded variables in `server.js`, and modifying
`post.ejs`. Fixing this is a current todo.
